\subsection{Introduction}

Thank for you attempting to take this survey. I ask that you avoid
spending a lot of time on a question unless you really want to.  Your
data might be given out but I promise to strip it of all identifiers
that would indicate it was you who answered this survey.  You can
answer somewhat informally if you want to. For the yes/no questions
you are free to provide a more detailed answer. If you are time
constrained just pick a few questions you want to answer.

To respond just return a list of answered numbered by their question
number. Most answers are a binary yes/no. If you don't want to answer
a question just leave it blank.

The URL \url{http://swag.uwaterloo.ca/~ahindle/yarn/} contains links
to all the animations.

\subsection{Postgresql Default}

Please view
\url{http://swag.uwaterloo.ca/~ahindle/yarn/postgresql.default.html} .  Don't
watch the whole thing. For all these links I recommend right clicking
and choosing medium or low quality settings in flash.

\begin{itemize}
\qitem Click around on the time-bar on the bottom. Did you see the change in the graph (yes/no)?
\qitem Could you tell how to Pause, Play and jump around in the animation (yes/no)?
\qitem Could you tell what the animation is about (yes/no)?
\end{itemize}

The animation is about the changes in coupling between modules in
PostgreSQL. Each text box is a module and each arc indicates the
number of calls between a module. Arcs point in one direction and are
often embedded in each other. So the animation is displaying and
highlighting the changes in coupling between modules of PostgreSQL
over time.

\begin{itemize}
\qitem Did the colors tell you anything (short answer)?
\qitem Were the colors misleading (yes/no)?
\qitem Was it annoying or helpful to pause the animation when you jumped around (annoying/helpful)?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Postgresql Default Decay}

Please view
\url{http://swag.uwaterloo.ca/~ahindle/yarn/postgresql.everything_colorful_decay.html} .  Don't
watch the whole thing. For all these links I recommend right clicking
and choosing medium or low quality settings in flash.

\begin{itemize}
\qitem Did the decaying colors help hi-light changes (yes/no)?
\qitem Did this animation seem more useful than the previous (yes/no)?
\qitem Were the colors misleading (yes/no)?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Postgresql Highlight Decay}

Please view
\url{http://swag.uwaterloo.ca/~ahindle/yarn/postgresql.highlight_decay.html} .  Don't
watch the whole thing. For all these links I recommend right clicking
and choosing medium or low quality settings in flash.

\begin{itemize}
\qitem Did the decaying color help hi-light changes (yes/no)?
\qitem Did this animation seem more useful than the previous (yes/no)?
\qitem Did the decaying color confuse anything (short-answer/yes/no)?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Postgresql Important}
Please view
\url{http://swag.uwaterloo.ca/~ahindle/yarn/postgresql.important.html}
.  Don't watch the whole thing. For all these links I recommend right
clicking and choosing medium or low quality settings in flash.

This animation highlights important changes to PostgreSQL; these
include changes which create new dependencies or changes which double
the dependencies. The changes are highlighted and do not decay till
another change comes occurs.

\begin{itemize}
%\qitem Can you tell when a change with small coupling is made (yes/no)?
%\qitem Can you tell when a change with large coupling is made (yes/no)?
\qitem What do you think this animation helps show (short answer)?
\qitem Could this animation be misleading (yes/no)?
\qitem Does this tell you anything about the frequency of change in coupling between modules (short answer)?
\qitem What does this animation tell you about the importance metric used (short answer)?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Postgresql Important Decay}
Please view

.  Don't watch the whole thing. For all these links I recommend right
clicking and choosing medium or low quality settings in flash.

This animation highlights important changes to PostgreSQL; these
include changes which create new dependencies or changes which double
the dependencies. The changes are highlighted and do not decay till
another change comes occurs.

\begin{itemize}
\qitem Was this animation better than the ``PostgreSQL Important'' animation in the previous section (yes/no)?
\qitem What do you think this animation helps show (short answer)?
\qitem Could this animation be misleading (yes/no)?
\qitem Was this animation too sparse or too boring (yes/no)?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Global Questions}

These questions are about all the animations:

\begin{itemize}
\qitem Could you tell when a change with small coupling is made (yes/no)?
\qitem Could you tell when a change with large coupling is made (yes/no)?
\qitem Did the edge widths help show any useful information to you (short answer/yes/no)?
\qitem Did these animations tell you anything about software architecture or software in general (short answer)?
\qitem What was the general feeling you had about these projects before? Did your feelings change? Did you expect to see what you saw? (short answer)
%expect to say messiness
\qitem Which animation schemes were the most useful (short answer)?
\qitem Would you use these animations on your own projects if they were easy to generate (yes/no)?
\qitem Would you use these animations on projects you were new to if they were easy to generate (yes/no)?
\qitem Would you ever use these animations if they were available to you (yes/no)?
\qitem Do you have any suggestions for improvement (short answer)?
\end{itemize}
