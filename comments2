X The related research section is way too short. Important references are
X missing and the mentioned related work are not compared with your approach.
X Just to mention some approaches which visualizes modules and dependencies
X between them: - 
X 
X Lungu et al. of CSMR 2007

X Evolutionary and Structural Analysis of Large Software Systems, WCRE '06 -

X reference is - T. Zimmermann and P. Weissgerber, Preprocessing CVS Data for

X - In figure 4 you say that the most notable dependency is between
X Util and System Control Manager. Why not also Parser and Executor with
X Util? They have the same color. 	

X figure 6 is it represented?
X 3. Section 5; penultimate paragraph â€“ I did not see these relationships
X in Figure 6.



X * indicate we looked at the immediate changes to the important change
X * what if a file moves
X * decay width gives wrong impression
X * radial simplicity
X *- p2: important change -> important changes 
X *- p3: can also add drastically alter -> can also drastically alter 
X *- p4: All of the the -> All of the -
X *- p4: stationery -> stationary 
X *- p5: dependencies of between modules -> dependencies between modules 
X *- p5: module for query rewriting queries -> module for rewriting queries 
X *- p6: introduce a linebreak before the Traffic
X Cop description
X * Small points: 1. Section 3.2; Architectural Mapping â€“ you use the term
X  â€˜deletedâ€™ but use â€˜removedâ€™ near the end of 3.1.
X * 2. Section 3.3; Cumulative Width â€“ did you mean log squared?
